## TEA Token

TEA tokens will be pre-allocated to investors, community members, the team, as well as being earmarked for other functions (liquidity pool / marketing). There will be 100 million TEA tokens pre-allocated in the genesis block, but most of that will be doled out according to a 1-2 year vesting schedule. When the TEA project mainnet goes live, miners will start to get TEA rewards through TEA mining (e.g. public services). 

## Camellia (CML)
Unlike TEA tokens, CML is an NFT (non-fungible token) and also functions as a special software license. Each CML has a different lifecycle just as each tree is different in nature. After a miner purchases frozen CML, they must wait for it to defrost to mine with it. Once their CML is defrosted, the miner can plant this CML into a mining machine to start mining to harvest TEA tokens. All CML are developed by ELK Insight LLC (US) and authorizes them to TEA Project Incï¼ˆSingapore). There are a total 10,000 CML in the genesis block: 1000 A type; 3000 B type and 6000 C type. 

# How to get CML NFT?

## Individual investors
The TEA Project won't do an airdrop but it will distribute CML to community contributors through mining contests. 

Starting in epoch 7, each week all mining contestants are able to choose to sell their TEA (mined TEA from mining contest) to TEA project team and get mainnet CML coupon which can be used to redeem for CML NFT and plant when the mainnet goes live. See more details in [Epoch 7 Mining Contest Rules](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Epoch-7).


## Institutional investors
In June 2021, the TEA Project completed its seed-round funding. Some top investors including Hashkey get 10% of the total TEA pre-allocation as investors. The TEA Project will start series A funding soon. If you're interested in investing our project, please contact us at info@teaproject.org
