# TEA Project

This is the open public repo for the Tea Project community.

The TEA Project is a decentralized cloud computing platform that hosts rich, decentralized applications known as "Rich dApps." Unlike typical apps, Rich dApps are decentralized; they are completely serverless and run purely on miner's nodes like a blockchain.  However, Rich dApps run more like centralized cloud-based apps, with similar high scalability and user experiences. TEA Project combines the best parts from both blockchain and cloud computing.

TEA Project has two layers, but unlike most layer-2 solutions that are trying to improve consensus algorithm, it is not attempting to improve blockchain; rather, TEA is capitalizing on the benefits of it. In the TEA project, dApps code runs on layer-2, a WebAssembly runtime inside hardware protected enclaves. These hardware enclaves generate PoT (Proof of Trust) data handled by the blockchain consensus on layer-1. Therefore, in TEA, blockchain doesn't use consensus to verify the result of dApps code, but the execution environment where the code runs. We work from the assumption that if the execution environment, code, and input data are trusted, then the execution result can also be trusted. 

TEA Project is based on IPFS, Blockchain, WebAssembly, and trusted computing technologies. By adding a TEA hardware security module, the IPFS node can also serve as a computing node besides just serving static content. 

TEA project has two tokens; TEA and CML (Camellia). TEA token is a stable utility token as gas, while the Camellia token is an NFT that presents the credit and capability of a TEA mining node.

## Discussions
Github's **Discussions** and **Wiki** will be used in this repo as the primary means of sharing information. These two features are accessible in the header of the page:

**Discussions** is a place for new and existing users to get answers to their questions about the project and interact with the project maintainers. It's a place for members to communicate: to share ideas or to ask for help, as well as a good place for newcomers to ask how they can contribute to the project.

To help make discussions useful for as many people as possible, users should:

- Categorize their discussions by posting them in the most appropriate forum.
- Mark a reply as a solution to their question to give closure.
- Search **Discussions** to see if their issue has been answered in the past.
- Migrate Github issues over as appropriate, especially those that need user input like new features. 

Up to four discussions can be pinned on the **Discussions** homepage. These could be used for issues that are needing regular discussion, but also serve as ideal sticky posts for compilations of learning material, code samples, and relevant project links.

## Documentation

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki) for full documentation, examples, as well as other information. The **Wiki** contains a lot of helpful information intended to help people participate in the project.

While [our blog](https://teaproject.medium.com) and [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/teaprojectorg/) are the best places to get the latest progress updates and news about the TEA Project, users can visit the **Wiki** to see how the project is developing.
