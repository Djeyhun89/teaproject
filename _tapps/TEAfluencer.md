## What is TEAfluencer?
TEAfluencer is a type of TApp that runs on layer2 of the TEA Project. TEAfluencer is a great platform for influencers (e.g. Youtubers) to engage with their fans/subscribers in a way that benefits both parties: influencers leverage the built-in bonding curve (on the TApp) to gain curator marketing by providing monetary incentives for their fans/audiences to market their work for them. The bonding curve also rewards influencers (creators) with passive income, set through dividends. TEAfluencer also includes a 'referral' program, designed to reward all parties who help bring more participants into the testnet mining contest. The referral program is broken down into smaller segments, which you can read about below:

## Referral program

### Influencer (referrer): 
* Anyone, especially crypto influencers, can be a referrer. 
* After receiving a special referral code from TEA Project (TEA Project will set up a special referral TApp for you) influencers can start bringing people into the community.
* Once a new participant (referee) joins a mining contest from the influencer's code and purchases testnet CML, TEA Project will pay the influencer half of the participant's money spent on CML. 
> * For example, if the participant spends 100 USDT, the influencer will get 50 USDT
> * TEA Project will also tip the TApp, which benefits the owner and investors of the TApp (influencers and the TApp's investors)
* * * TEA tips [100*participant spendings] into the TApp. In the above example, TEA will tip 10,000 T


### Sales person (refer-an-influencer):
* For those who aren’t influencers, but have access to many influences, can also participate in this program!
* Those who refer-an-influencer can earn the same as what the influencers earn
> * Example: Bob knows Lucy is an influencer, and refers TEA Project to her
> * Through Lucy’s referrals to her fans, she earns 100 TEA.
> * Bob can earn the same amount of Lucy’s total earnings, in this case, 100 TEA


## What do they need to do?
