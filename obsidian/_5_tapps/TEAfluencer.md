# TEA Fluencer TApp
When you're new to the TEA Project, we assume that you don't have any TEA tokens in your wallet. TEA tokens are the utility tokens used to pay gas fees on the TEA Project network, similar to how ETH works on the Ethereum network. By engaging in actions such as quoting and retweeting, you can earn a certain amount of testnet credit. This credit is designed to help you get started by covering gas fees whenever a transaction occurs on the TEA Project network.

## Rules for Credit:

1. Credit can only be used for covering gas fees on the TEA Project.
2. Credit will be reduced by 10% daily.
3. Credit cannot be transferred and withdrew.
