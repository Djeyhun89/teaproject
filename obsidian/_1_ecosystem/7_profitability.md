# Profitability of TEA Ecosystem Participants

There are multiple ways of achieving profitability in the TEA ecosystem. Being an investor in TApp or CML bonding curve tokens is one way to earn TEA value. But a more active way is to actually engage in the TEA ecosystem in one of the three following ways.

## Profitability Calculations for TEA Ecosystem Participants

### Become a miner

- Miners get paid gas by the end users when they use their hosting node to run TApps.
- They receive public service rewards paid through the Harberger Tax on state maintainer nodes.
- Miners may pay an optional state subscription fee to receive faster state machine updates.
- They pay for CML seeds as a license to run their hosting nodes on the TEA network.

(note that revenue to miners goes to their CML bonding curve tokens with a theta % going directly to the CML owner).

### Become a TApp developer

- TApp developers earn a TApp usage fee paid by end-users to use their TApp.
- They earn revenue from in-app purchases from end-users.
- They pay txn fees and a memory tax to the state maintainer nodes.

(note that revenue to TApps goes to their TApp bonding curve tokens with a theta % going directly to the TApp owner).

### Become a state maintainer node

 - State maintainers earn revenue from txn fees and the memory tax paid by TApps.
- They pay for the right to run a state maintainer node.
- They pay a Harberger Tax based on their self-valuation price that goes to CML nodes and the TEA DAO.

More detailed information on revenue and expenses for the above TEA Project entities are available in our dev docs.
