# WebAssembly
## WASM
In the TEA Project, dApps run WebAssembly (Wasm) code on layer-2 within hardware-protected enclaves. TEA's use of Wasm means developers can use the programming language they're accustomed to using, making it much more straightforward for developers to deploy apps to Web3 through the TEA Project. Additionally, developers accustomed to the front-end / back-end / database tiers of the cloud computing tech stack will also find them present in the TEA Project. TApps follow the same three-tier architecture prevalent in cloud computing (presentation tier, app tier, and database tier), but TEA Project TApps run fully decentralized.

Applications can run full speed on the TEA Project's layer-2 because, from the app's point of view, it looks just like a normal three-tier cloud computing architecture. And developers themselves don't need any special knowledge about blockchain or consensus algorithms to get the decentralization and security benefits inherent in the TEA Project's 2-layer blockchain. They just need to set WebAssembly as their code compilation target while still using their preferred programming languages.
