# TEA Project Intro
TEA Project is a decentralized cloud computing platform that hosts rich, decentralized applications known as [[_tapps/README | TApps]]. These are completely decentralized running in miners' nodes or between peer-to-peer clients. By offering highly-scalable and decentralized apps, TEA Project combines the best of both blockchain and cloud computing. 

Going through the links below in order will give you a good overview of the TEA Project, what we're trying to accomplish, and how we're going about it.

- [TEA Project's Litepaper](z_litepaper.md) gives an overview of the TEA Project and how it's going about solving the problems inherent with decentralized compute.
- The litepaper is a good overview on how TEA's roots of trust combine to form TEA's decentralized compute platform. Those interested in more technical details can [read the following article](4_tea-technical-details.md) as well as more on our apps' binary format, [WASM](3.5_wasm.md).
- [An example application](6_example-tea-in-use.md) that shows how TEA ecosystem participants interact with each other and the underlying architecture including token incentives.  For more information on how participants are rewarded, see the following [article on profitability](7_profitability.md).
- The TEA Project has two system level tokens: [[_token/tea-tokens/README | TEA]], a utility token used for gas on the network, and [[_token/cml-tokens/README | CML]], an NFT that functions as a mining license. More info is available in our [tokens section](../_token/README.md). Besides these system tokens, users can create their own token using [Bonding Curves](https://github.com/systems-explained/awesome-bonding). The creators can use these token to pay in their [[_tapps/README | TApps]] or as an investment tool.
