# TEA Project Example Use Case
The TEA Project is looking to disrupt the world of cloud computing by enabling decentralized apps to run on the blockchain at cloud computing speeds. Because we no longer have the cloud servers of web 2.0, we must incentivize miners to provide the underlying infrastructure. IPFS is the actual storage infrastructure for storing both encrypted app and client data, which miners will host within their protected enclaves when their node is selected for a task.

Let's look at the economic incentives for a hypothetical Tensorflow image recognition TApp running on the TEA network:

-   The **developer** uploads their Tensorflow image recognition analysis TApp to IPFS.
-   A **photographer** uploads their pictures to IPFS.
-   A **researcher** wants to use the **developer's** TApp with the **photographer's** pictures.
-   A random **miner** is selected to host the Tensorflow TApp and the pictures within the protected enclave of their mining machine.

In economic terms, the **researcher** pays to use the TApp. The payment flows through the **miner** who provided the node to perform the secure and private calculation, the **photographer** who is paid for the use of their pictures, and the **developer** who is paid for the usage of their code. Every transaction enriches a wide variety of participants in the TEA ecosystem and helps sustain and incentivize further usage.

## TEA's Paradox: No one has to trust anyone else
Because the TEA Project is able to provide the underlying trust, there's no longer any trust required between all four parties.

The TEA Project is able to provide all participants a decentralized computation network that is both secure and private. In practical terms, that means the developer who wrote the code cannot breach the photographer's image. And the miner who is randomly selected to host it in their enclave cannot access either the photographer's data or the developer's code. And the researcher is only able to receive the result of the app's calculation and isn't able to access the photographer's data outside of the enclave. The security and privacy that the TEA Project's decentralized computing network is able to provide has wide range of emerging use cases like residential IoT data and patient health records.
