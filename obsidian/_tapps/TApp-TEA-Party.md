# The TEA Party Social Messaging App
Users can now message each other within the TEA browser wallet using a **TEA Party** TApp. The TEA Party is a template that TApp creators can use to host their own messaging app. Every instance of a TApp using this template is called a **TEA Table**. The TEA Project team hosts a TEA Table known as the **Help Desk** where contestants can ask questions.

From the image above, you can see what the TEA Table interface looks like.
- Users log in and can post messages.
- Starting in epoch 7, posting messages will cost a certain amount of TEA.
- There is an expiration date printed next to each message. Users can pay extra to bump their message and extend the duration of the message.
- There is also a red delete icon to remove any message that the user themselves have posted.

# TEA Party TApps Earn Tips
During the mining contest epochs, TEA Party-based TApps will earn tips every 1000 blocks during contest rounds. The amount of the consume action is as follows:
- 10T per message.
- Maximum tip of 1000T per 1000 blocks.
- A minimum of 1T is tipped out every 1000 blocks (in case there are no messages during that block time).

Keep in mind that this amount of TEA tipped out is used to buy the TApp's tokens which is then distributed proportionally to token holders and miners.
