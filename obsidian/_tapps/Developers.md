# TEA Project Developers

- [TEA app developers compile to WebAssembly](https://medium.com/@teaproject/tea-and-webassembly-89991a83bbd1) which allows devs to code in their preferred language before compiling to WASM.
- [How does the TEA Project's business model support the token value and price?](https://medium.com/@teaproject/the-tea-token-model-how-does-the-business-support-value-price-ff5f8278e4fc). Developers are part of the ecosystem that entices users to buy the TEA token in order to use their TApps.
- Developers will also want to familiarize themselves with how the [bonding curve works](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/TApp-Token-Supply-and-Demand), in particular the [theta percentage](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Bonding-Curve-Theta) that goes directly to developers. Devs can also elect to pay miners in [staked TApp tokens](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Mining:-Staked-TApp-Tokens).

In addition to the extensive use of open-source software, the TEA Project has developed unique technologies to support its multi-layered blockchain model. There is currently no outsourcing of development.

Open-source technologies used by the TEA Project include:

* IPFS
* Substrate
* WebAssembly
* Wasmer, Wasmtime
* Parsec
* NixOS
* WolfTPM
* Nats service
* Technical framework language: 90% Rust, 5% GoLang, 5% JS.
