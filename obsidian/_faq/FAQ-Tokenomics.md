# FAQ - Tokenomics

TEA Projects uses many new economic innovations in our tokenomics design. To name a few:

1. The use of a [Harberger tax](https://teaproject.medium.com/proposal-using-a-harberger-tax-in-the-global-state-machine-4323976f9b8) to allocate state maintainer seats.
2. [The bonding curve](../_token/Bonding-curve.md) to control the price and supply of TApp and CML node tokens.
3. Because the TEA Project has no limit on block size, most TApps only incur a negligible gas fee from the enduser's perspective. More information on how our [gas fee is calculated](https://teaproject.medium.com/the-importance-of-the-tea-utility-token-ccf006f62ca9) can be found on our blog.
