# TEA Project Epochs
The TEA Project will be running on testnets through Epoch 14. The different testing phases are broken up into **epochs** with Epoch 11 marking our transition to Ethereum's Goerli testnet. Each epoch has its own contest associated with it where end-users compete to gain testnet TEA tokens which can be redeemed for mainnet TEA vouchers (COFFEE).

## How long is each testnet epoch, and how does it compare to mainnet?

The testnet epochs are on an accelerated schedule during contests with 10 blocks per minute.

We originally compressed 2 years time into 14 days, using the accelerated shedule of 14 (days) * 24 (hours) * 60 (minutes) * 10 (blocks per minute) during the testnet. But the epochs have evolved to last varying lengths of time as the team will move to a new epoch only once they feel enough progress has been made.

## How to Participate in an Epoch

Each of our epochs is open to community members where they can earn testnet TEA and exchange them for COFFEE, which are our mainnet TEA vouchers. To participate in a testnet epoch to earn COFFEE tokens redeemable for mainnet TEA:

1. Set up an Ethereum address using the MetaMask wallet.
2. Use the **TEA Fluencer** TApp to quote retweet the listed tweet and activate the testnet TEA faucet.
3. Use the **Leader Board** TApp to register for the current epoch competition. Registering on the Leader Board will ensure that your testnet TEA tokens are counted for distribution of COFFEE rewards and for rollover into the next epoch.

## When Will the Mainnet Be Live?

The eventual launch date of the mainnet depends on the progress of the project. You can see from every epoch that the product is advancing rapidly. If everything goes well, we hope that the mainnet will go live in early 2023. However, this expectation may change at any time.

## Are the TEA and CML in the contest real tokens?
No, they're part of the simulation. CML and TEA during the competition should be thought of as "testnet CML" and "testnet TEA" which have no relation to mainnet CML or TEA. Even though these two coins are fictitious for the purposes of our mining contest, the testnet TEA that contestants earn during the contest will be exchanged for COFFEE during the epochs. The COFFEE can be exchanged for real TEA after the mainnet launches.

## What are TApps?
Decentralized apps (dApps) are known as **TApps** in the TEA ecosystem. Each TApp has a token associated with it that's issued on a bonding curve, which means early buyers reap more rewards as the supply of the TApp Token increases. 

Miners are also paid out in TApp tokens when they host TApps who've elected to payout in their own tokens. For more information about TApps, visit this [collection of links explaining TApps](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/TApps).

## On which network is the TEA token on?

The TEA token is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network. The mainnet target launch date is early 2023.

TEA project is a layer2 solution that will run above multiple blockchains (layer1) in the future though Ethereum will remain our primary layer1 .

## What is the leaderboard?
The Leaderboard is a TApp that shows an updated list of how well contestants are doing based on their net asset value. Note that the leaderboard calculation doesn't take into consideration the value of your COFFEE vouchers (i.e. when you exchange some of your testnet TEA for COFFEE vouchers, you're asset value will go down).

## How to invest in TEA Project?
If you are an accredited investor (e.g. a VC), please contact us at  info@teaproject.org to join our private sale.
 
If youâ€™re an individual, so far the best way is to join the various epoch competitions. Your earned testnet TEA tokens can be converted into COFFEE which can be converted into mainnet TEA.
