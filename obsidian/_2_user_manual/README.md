## TApplication on Web and Mobile

  
TEA Applications, abbreviated as TApps, feature a user interface akin to conventional Web Apps. They can operate on both computer web browsers and the Metamask browser on mobile phones. While both the PC web and mobile web execute the same logic, the mobile version is customized to suit the smaller screen size. Consequently, you may need additional clicks for more details to be expanded.

{% hint style="info" %}
** Running TApps with Metamask on Your Mobile Phone**

To run TApps on your smartphone, you must first install Metamask. While TApps can be loaded on a regular mobile web browser, the Metamask browser is currently the most stable option when your digital signature is required for login or payment. This stability is attributed to Metamask's built-in browser, where the TApp runs seamlessly, eliminating the need to switch to another mobile app for signature purposes. You are welcome to use any mobile browser to launch TApps, but if you encounter issues with Metamask signature, consider using the Metamask app instead.

Comparison of PC Web and Mobile UI

![[Pasted image 20231212150437.png]]

The PC Web interface (on the left) provides more detailed information compared to the mobile web interface (on the right). Users may need to click on a specific row to access additional detailed information.

### Metamask signature comparison

On a PC, Metamask functions as a browser extension. When a TApp requires a user to sign a transaction, the Metamask extension will pop up. On mobile, the browser is a window within the Metamask app. To use a TApp, you must click the browser icon to switch to the browser window and then launch the TApp inside. When the TApp prompts the user to sign a transaction, Metamask will switch to the wallet window to complete the signing process.

## Entry point: Alpha is testnet, Beta is mainnet

- https://alpha.teaproject.org is Alpha testnet entry point URL
- https://beta.teaproject.org is the mainnet entry point URL.

{% hint style="info" %}

**Why beta?**

Beta.teaproject.org is **NOT** a testnet; it is the mainnet for the TEA Project. The usage of the domain name "beta" reflects the early stage of the TEA Project mainnet. The TEA Project core team is actively addressing bugs and implementing frequent improvements during this phase. Throughout this period, the TEA core team will manage all state machine nodes to facilitate fast and consistent upgrades. The profits generated by the state machine nodes are handled by SEAT owners, not the core team. We anticipate running under the "beta" domain for approximately 2 years. Once the system achieves stability and is deemed suitable for public use, the "beta" designation will be removed from the domain name.

Regardless of its label as "beta" or "not a beta," it functions as the mainnet, and all tokens on Beta are indeed **real**.

In the TEA Project, connecting to the Web 3 world requires selecting a **hosting node** as your designated **gateway**, distinguishing it from the conventional Web 2 approach.

{% hint style="info" %}

** How can I select a hosting node? **:

Regardless of the hosting node you choose, you can expect nearly identical user experiences, as only those passing the **remote attestation** are featured on the listâ€”ensuring security and reliability.

However, each node may vary in performance and capability. Note the **market cap** column in the table, akin to the valuation of a publicly listed company (in this case, the node). Typically, nodes with superior performance garner higher profits, attracting more investors and thus achieving a higher market cap. The hosting list table is organized based on market cap rankings.

If you have no specific preferences, opting for the top-ranked hosting nodes should suffice.

Upon connecting to a hosting node, your gas fee becomes its revenue. The current billing model measures gas fees solely based on the consumption of executing code, irrespective of the hosting node. This model may evolve in the future to distribute workload based on available free memory or CPU usage.

{% endhint %}

Every row in this table represents a hosting node provided by a TEA miner. When you click and connect to a hosting node, you will be redirected to the TEA mini-runtime service running on that specific node. You may observe that the URL has changed in your browser's address bar.

The IP address corresponds to the hosting node, while the lengthy hash in the screenshot, depicted as `mey32oBSYMPPjxYjeSCDwZsFM3m9SWodq25pLa9gy9cji`, is referred to as CID (Content ID) in the **IPFS** protocol. This CID represents the current hash of the **TAppStore** application's front-end code. It's important to note that this CID may change whenever the TAppStore undergoes an update.

## Common Login Features in Most TApps

While each TApp has its unique characteristics, many share common features like login/logout.
