## TApplication on Web and Mobile

  
TEA Applications, abbreviated as TApps, feature a user interface akin to conventional Web Apps. They can operate on both computer web browsers and the Metamask browser on mobile phones. While both the PC web and mobile web execute the same logic, the mobile version is customized to suit the smaller screen size. Consequently, you may need additional clicks for more details to be expanded.

** Running TApps with Metamask on Your Mobile Phone**

To run TApps on your smartphone, you must first install Metamask. While TApps can be loaded on a regular mobile web browser, the Metamask browser is currently the most stable option when your digital signature is required for login or payment. This stability is attributed to Metamask's built-in browser, where the TApp runs seamlessly, eliminating the need to switch to another mobile app for signature purposes. You are welcome to use any mobile browser to launch TApps, but if you encounter issues with Metamask signature, consider using the Metamask app instead.

Comparison of PC Web and Mobile UI

The PC Web interface (on the left) provides more detailed information compared to the mobile web interface (on the right). Users may need to click on a specific row to access additional detailed information.

### Metamask signature comparison

On a PC, Metamask functions as a browser extension. When a TApp requires a user to sign a transaction, the Metamask extension will pop up. On mobile, the browser is a window within the Metamask app. To use a TApp, you must click the browser icon to switch to the browser window and then launch the TApp inside. When the TApp prompts the user to sign a transaction, Metamask will switch to the wallet window to complete the signing process.

## Entry point: Alpha is testnet, Beta is mainnet

https://alpha.teaproject.org is Alpha testnet entry point URL
https://beta.teaproject.org is the mainnet entry point URL.

{% hint style="info" %}

**Why beta?**

Beta.teaproject.org is **NOT** a testnet; it is the mainnet for the TEA Project. The usage of the domain name "beta" reflects the early stage of the TEA Project mainnet. The TEA Project core team is actively addressing bugs and implementing frequent improvements during this phase. Throughout this period, the TEA core team will manage all state machine nodes to facilitate fast and consistent upgrades. The profits generated by the state machine nodes are handled by SEAT owners, not the core team. We anticipate running under the "beta" domain for approximately 2 years. Once the system achieves stability and is deemed suitable for public use, the "beta" designation will be removed from the domain name.

Regardless of its label as "beta" or "not a beta," it functions as the mainnet, and all tokens on Beta are indeed **real**.
