# TApp Creation

## The Creator is the Owner of the TApp

Whoever creates a TApp is the owner. The owner is able to decide the name, the initial tokens, and the theta % of every consume and and buy action that goes directly to the owner. There's an initial funding amount (in TEA tokens) that's required to issue the tokens and start a TApp. If for example the owner will take a theta of 10% as their bonding curve incentive, every consume or buy action on the token's bonding curve will net them 10% directly to their wallets.

## Creating a New TApp

The owner will choose the following parameters when creating new TApps:

## Create New TApp - Name

This is where you give your TApp a name. You'll also choose a symbol for it in the space right below to uniquely identify it in the TApp list.

## Create new TApp - Initial tokens

TApp creators are responsible for their TApp's initial token funding. The number of initial tokens you wish to fund for your TApp. You can click the **Calculate** button to see what your initial cost in TEA will be for funding your chosen number of tokens. 

## Theta

The percentage of each consume / sell action that goes directly to the developer. See more info at [bonding curve theta](Bonding-Curve-Theta.md)
