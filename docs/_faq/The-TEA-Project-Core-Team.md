## Kevin G. Zhang

The founder, [Kevin G Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevingzhang/), graduated from Tsinghua University and currently lives in Silicon Valley, USA. In 2015, when he was the CTO of Silicon Valley startup iHealth Labs, he discovered a market need that couldn't be met. At that time, iHealth Labs already had a large number of patients' medical data. However, it was barely used due to the strict regulations protecting medical data and the inability of the internet infrastructure at that time to protect it in transit. That became the starting point for Kevin's idea of establishing a trusted computing environment to protect patient privacy data.
In 2017, he entered the blockchain industry and determined that it was the best direction to solve the privacy requirements for such important data. He established ELK Insight LLC to continue his technical research. In 2018, he began work as an independent contractor for  technical community development in the blockchain space. During this time, Kevin started to become disillusioned with the blockchain technology of the companies he was contracted to work for. Most importantly, he felt that they couldn't reach the trust necessary to safeguard critical data. His insistence on the use of trusted hardware to achieve distributed computing led him to leave his work as a contractor in 2019 and begin working on a solution to this problem. Kevin then began researching and developing the TEA Project, which he's continued to this day.
