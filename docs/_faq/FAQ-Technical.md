# FAQ - Technical

## What makes the project different from its competitors?

Compared to other blockchains, the TEA Project isn't really even technically a blockchain although also being decentralized. TEA Project reaches the same goal but through a different technical approach. And there are other well known blockchain projects that are like TEA Project in that they're not really blockchain at all: IPFS, Helium, and Dfinity. TEA Project is similar to these projects in that we're all trying to make a decentralized world, same as blockchains, but through different means. That is to say that TEA Project doesn't have blocks, and there's no chain. It's more reasonably called a "decentralized cloud" or "decentralized database". 

Because we don't rely on blockchain for consensus, the TEA Project can solve most of the problems that are intrinsic to blockchains:

1. Expensive
1. Slow
1. Hard to use, etc. 

To be fair, our solution does require trusted computing hardware and GPS satellite receivers. TEA Project is part of the decentralized cloud niche where there are further specializations. Some projects focus on decentralized storage, some focus on decentralized networking. TEA Project and very few others are focused on computing. Among those who also are focused on computing, TEA Project uses hardware security instead of the software algorithms that are typically used by our competitors like Dfinity. There are pros and cons of each solution which are explored more on our [Medium blog](https://teaproject.medium.com/where-does-the-trust-in-t-rust-come-from-f0b67117d238).

Another technical innovation is TEA's decentralized use of concepts introduced by [Google Spanner](https://teaproject.medium.com/proof-of-time-how-googles-truetime-can-be-used-in-the-blockchain-55f87b41cb3a). Timestamps are widely used in distributed databases such as Google Spanner. These are instrumental in many of Google's services (gmail, google doc, calendar etc.) in sorting asyncrynous data. The TEA Project is the first blockchain / decentralized cloud project to use such a technology using a decentralized and distributed compute network. For further information on how we've adapted Google Spanner concepts into the decentralized world of Web3, see our [in-depth Medium post](https://teaproject.medium.com/proof-of-time-how-googles-truetime-can-be-used-in-the-blockchain-55f87b41cb3a).
