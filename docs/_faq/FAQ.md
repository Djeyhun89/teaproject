## When Will the Mainnet Be Live?

The eventual launch date of the mainnet depends on the progress of the project. You can see from every epoch that the product is advancing rapidly. If everything goes well, we hope that the mainnet will go live in early 2023. However, this expectation may change at any time.

## Are the TEA and CML in the contest real tokens?

No, they're part of the simulation. CML and TEA during the competition should be thought of as "testnet CML" and "testnet TEA" which have no relation to mainnet CML or TEA. Even though these two coins are fictitious for the purposes of our mining contest, the testnet TEA that contestants earn during the contest will be exchanged for COFFEE during the epochs. The COFFEE can be exchanged for real TEA after the mainnet launches.

## What are TApps?

Decentralized apps (dApps) are known as **TApps** in the TEA ecosystem. Each TApp has a token associated with it that's issued on a bonding curve, which means early buyers reap more rewards as the supply of the TApp Token increases. 

Miners are also paid out in TApp tokens when they host TApps who've elected to payout in their own tokens. For more information about TApps, visit this [collection of links explaining TApps](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/TApps).

## On which network is the TEA token on?

The TEA token is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network. The mainnet target launch date is early 2023.

TEA project is a layer2 solution that will run above multiple blockchains (layer1) in the future though Ethereum will remain our primary layer1 .

## What is the leaderboard?

The Leaderboard is a TApp that shows an updated list of how well contestants are doing based on their net asset value. Note that the leaderboard calculation doesn't take into consideration the value of your COFFEE vouchers (i.e. when you exchange some of your testnet TEA for COFFEE vouchers, you're asset value will go down).

## How to invest in TEA Project?

If you are an accredited investor (e.g. a VC), please contact us at  info@teaproject.org to join our private sale.

If youâ€™re an individual, so far the best way is to join the various epoch competitions. Your earned testnet TEA tokens can be converted into COFFEE which can be converted into mainnet TEA.

More information on our mainnet CML and TEA as well as how to invest is available [in our wiki](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Where-to-buy-TEA-token-and-CML%3F).
