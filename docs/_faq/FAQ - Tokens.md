## Why is TEA considered a utility token?

TEA tokens are a measure of how much computing resources are used for a computing task. For example, whn you click the "buy token" button in the TAppStore application, that sets off a series of computational tasks on many servers (we call them TEA nodes). These TEA nodes are run by our community members like you who we call miners. They need to get paid for providing such computing services for the enduser. TEA is the token we use to measure how much you need to pay them. This is similar to Ethereum's gas fee.
