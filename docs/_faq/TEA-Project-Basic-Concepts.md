## TEA Project Basic Concepts

TEA Project includes a lot of innovative concepts which might be difficult to understand at once. Therefore, we need this wiki to help community members understand these concepts. 

We will introduce a few concepts below:

## Three roles in the TEA Project

There are three active roles in the TEA ecosystem:

* Miners: They own hardware mining machines, purchase CML (NFT, it's like software license), provide computing services and get rewarded with TEA.
* Investors: Users with TEA funds can invest in mining machines, TApps or even CML and TEA in order to get ROI. 
* Developers: They use the TEA framework to develop TApps which run on mining machines and provide services to earn revenue which would be distributed to investors and miners according to smart contracts on a bonding curve.

These three roles are not exclusive. Anyone can take two even three roles. For example, developers can run mining machines and also invest in their own TApps. 

Consumers are a special case since they may not know the TEA Project at all while they use TApps as they use other web or mobile apps like PayPal. Consumers help the ecosystem by providing demand for TEA tokens and TApps through their usage even though they may not consider themselves part of the ecosystem. These consumers could become investors themselves by buying the TApp tokens of the TApps they use should they develop an interest in the TEA ecosystem.
