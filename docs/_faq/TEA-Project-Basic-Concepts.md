## TEA Project Basic Concepts

## Three roles in the TEA Project

There are three active roles in the TEA ecosystem:

* Miners: They own hardware mining machines, purchase CML (NFT, it's like software license), provide computing services and get rewarded with TEA.
* Investors: Users with TEA funds can invest in mining machines, TApps or even CML and TEA in order to get ROI. 
* Developers: They use the TEA framework to develop TApps which run on mining machines and provide services to earn revenue which would be distributed to investors and miners according to smart contracts on a bonding curve.

These three roles are not exclusive. Anyone can take two even three roles. For example, developers can run mining machines and also invest in their own TApps.
