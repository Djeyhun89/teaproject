## When Will the Mainnet Be Live?

The eventual launch date of the mainnet depends on the progress of the project. You can see from every epoch that the product is advancing rapidly. If everything goes well, we hope that the mainnet will go live in early 2023. However, this expectation may change at any time.

## How to invest in TEA Project?

If you are an accredited investor (e.g. a VC), please contact us at  info@teaproject.org to join our private sale.

If youâ€™re an individual, so far the best way is to join the various epoch competitions. Your earned testnet TEA tokens can be converted into COFFEE which can be converted into mainnet TEA.

More information on our mainnet CML and TEA as well as how to invest is available [in our wiki](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Where-to-buy-TEA-token-and-CML%3F).
