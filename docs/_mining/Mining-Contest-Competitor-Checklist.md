The signup form can be used to register for test epochs as well, check on the latest status by visiting [our Telegram group](https://t.me/teaprojectorg).

Competitors will need to first install the polkadot{.js} extension and setup a wallet account.

# Install the Polkadot{.js} Extension 
The polkadot{.js} extension is available for the [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd), [Brave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd), or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension/) browsers. Other browsers compatible with Chrome should be compatible with the Polkadot extension, check [github](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension) for more information. 

The Pokadot extension does not allow for full wallet capabilities. It's only focused on managing your accounts and providing signing capabilities to apps requesting access.

#### Create a Wallet Account

Click the **+** button and select the first option to create a new account:

![](https://github.com/tearust/tea-docs/blob/main/FAQ/polkadot-add-account.png?raw=true)

Follow the instructions to generate your new key pair.

Please keep your private key secret. During the preview stage, tokens in this account are not real TEA tokens and can only be used on the testnet. But it's still good practice to keep your private key as secure as possible.

# You Need Some Initial TEA to Participate in the Mining Contest
Because TEA is only generated from mining rewards and contestants are all joining at the beginning, there's no TEA yet in the system. Contestants can put some of their CML seeds up for loans in order to get the TEA necessary to secure the first stake of their mining machines. We have a Genesis bank that issues contestants loans for the following amount:

- 1500T per C CML pledged as collateral.
- 3000T per B CML used as collateral.

# TEA Browser Wallet Functions

The three ways to generate TEA are either to mine, stake, or invest in TApp tokens. To begin mining, you would plant a CML seed into a TEA mining machine to generate TEA tokens. Look for the little icon here in your CML seed's row to plant your seed into a miner:

For more information on setting up your mining machine, visit [the mining guide](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Mining-With-Your-Own-Hardware).

# Staking TEA

Staking is a method of generating revenue without requiring the user to have a mining machine. Some people lack the knowledge, capital, or patience necessary to run a mining machine. Others may have TEA tokens but lack the CML NFT necessary to start up a mining machine. 

Staking is a method similar to mining that can generate income for a contestant. Staking can be done on any mining machine operating on the TEA network. Each staking slot requires either 1000 or 1 defrosted CML seed. You may stake or unstake every 1000 blocks. Note that if you elect to stake with a CML seed, you gain a number of slots according to the strength of your seed: 4 for A seeds, 2 for B seeds, and 1 slot for C seeds. To start staking, select the "Mining Camellia" link in the header. Click on the **Stake** button for any miner you want to stake with:

![](https://github.com/tearust/tea-docs/blob/main/res/Try_the_demo/demo-cml.png?raw=true)

You can either select one of your non-staked and defrosted CML for staking, or leave the CML unselected and the system will automatically take 1000 TEA for your staked amount.

Note that all CML seeds have a defrost schedule visible in your wallet. Only CML seeds in the defrosted stage can be used to plant or stake in mining machines.

Besides mining and staking, contestants can increase their TEA assets by investing in TApp tokens. There's more information on TApp tokens [in our wiki](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/TApp-Token-Supply-and-Demand). 

# Note that Each Mining Contest is Divided into Epochs
Every mining contest happens within an epoch: the blockchain resets to **0** block time and the amount of TEA in the system is also 0. That is why we pay out rewards at the end of every epoch. Starting in epoch 7, we will move to a continuous contest model where the blockchain is not reset and rewards will accrue across epochs.

# TEA mining rewards can be traded for mainnet CML
Participants in the TEA mining contests can exchange their contest TEA for mainnet CML vouchers at various intervals throughout the contest by using [the reward exchange form](https://forms.gle/JvZEE5J2DyM5fZHu5).
