# Hosting profitability

Miners deploy their mining machines on the TEA network to earn profit. To start earning on the network, miners will need the following:

* A hosted or local machine. Mining hardware is designed to be affordable for miners as they'll just require a Raspberry Pi with GPS and TPM chips. The TEA Project also runs on AWS Nitro which is therefore an option for miners who don't want to run local hardware.
* A CML NFT. Camellia (CML) NFTs are needed as a mining license to activate mining nodes. Miners interested in hosting TApps will purchase a B CML. These are purchased through CML auctions, an open process where winning bids are taken in TEA (which is burned) in exchange for CML.

# How miners determine the potential revenue?

In the TEA Project, we use the terms "mining" and "running a node" interchangeably. There are three types of mining available:

* State machine maintainer mining. Running a state maintainer node helps maintain the TEA Project's state machine. These miners pay a Harberger Tax for the privilege of running a state maintainer node and earns revenue from the memory tax paid by TApps.
* CML TApp hosting mining. When a user says they want to mine on the TEA Project, they will probably be running a B CML node. In addition to TEA public service rewards, B CML earn a share of the TApp tokens of the TApps they host as most TApp developers will choose TApp tokens as the hosting payout model.
* Private CML availability attestation mining. Private CML are necessary for home users to run their own nodes in their home. They can earn income through making sure CML hosting nodes are online. These are only modest rewards for performing this public service since they aren't able to be used by others to host arbitrary TApps.
