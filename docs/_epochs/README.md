## The TEA Project's Epochs

* [Epoch 2](Epoch-2.md) was the first epoch where contestants participated in the TEA mining contest. 
* [Epoch 3](Epoch-3.md) introduced the concept of COFFEE as CML coupons were no longer free. 
* [Epoch 4](Epoch-4.md) introduced TApps (and their tokens) which could be created by contestants to earn a portion of its revenue.
* [Epoch 5](Epoch-5.md)  introduced cloud computing-based mining to the TEA Project's mining contest.
* [Epoch 6](Epoch-6.md) did away with COFFEE as contestants now had to use their own crypto funds to purchase CML contest vouchers. A new type of social networking TApp called [TEA Party](TApp-TEA-Party) is also available to be created.
* [Epoch 7](Epoch-7.md) introduced weekly redemptions for mainnet CML vouchers as we move beyond USDT rewards. 
* [Epoch 8](Epoch-8.md) as the goal of making the block size smaller by reducing tipping frequency and moving more logic from layer-1 to layer-2 as we work to get our layer-1 as streamlined as possible as we look forward to becoming a flexible layer-2 that can run on top of other blockchains.
* [Epoch 9](Epoch-9.md) reintroduced COFFEE as a proxy for bridged-USD and improves its price stability to more tangible backing. Epoch 9 also saw an improved release of the TEA Party TApp that includes private messaging.
