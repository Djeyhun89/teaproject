# Epoch 5

Beginning in epoch 5, mining will become even more realistic as contestants will need to use cloud computers to run their mining machines. That means theyâ€™ll need to have command line experience firing up cloud instances on services like AWS and Digital Ocean. We want to make the mining contest as close to reality as possible. This means that miners in epoch 5 will have more technical hurdles to successfully mine as we prepare them for the technical requirements necessary to be a miner on the TEA network.
