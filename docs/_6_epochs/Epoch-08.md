# Epoch 8

Epoch 8 continues to require contestants to pay to purchase contest CML seeds. The contest seeds can be bought using the [purchase form](https://forms.gle/9McACwtEeyX4GXov6).

## Rules for Epoch 8

* The tipping rounds will happen every 1000 blocks instead of every 100 blocks as before. Weâ€™re reducing the tipping frequency for TApps to help speed up the sync time of new nodes onboarding onto the network.

* Epoch 7 rules will still apply to epoch 8.
