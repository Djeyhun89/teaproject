# Togar3 Game: Tea Open agar.io for Web3

Togar3 stands for Tea Open agar.io for Web3. It is a web3 modified version of [agar.io game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar.io) based on [Ogar3](https://github.com/Faris90/Ogar3) open source project. 

## Togar3 as an Airdrop

While Togar3 is a thrilling game experience, it also doubles as an innovative airdrop tool designed to distribute TEA tokens to our valued community members.

Unlike traditional airdrops where token acquisition relies solely on chance, Togar3 offers a more engaging and interactive approach:

* Forget passive drops: Instead of directly distributing TEA tokens, we airdrop "food" and "bots" within the game itself. Players then compete with each other and AI-controlled bots to collect this valuable in-game currency.
* Food = value: Each piece of food functions as a "bonding-curve" token, meaning its value increases as more players acquire it. This creates a dynamic in-game economy where players can strategically collect and sell their food for TEA tokens on the TEA Project platform.
* Unlock your TEA: Once you've accumulated TEA tokens, the possibilities are endless! Use them to cover gas fees, swap them for other ERC20 tokens on Uniswap, or explore the various utilities offered within the TEA ecosystem.

With Togar3, airdrops become an exciting adventure, rewarding players for their skills and engagement within the game world. So, are you ready to join the fun and claim your share of the TEA bounty? Dive into Togar3 today!

## Togar3 vs Ogar3

Comparing with web2 version Ogar, there are major improvements specificly designed for Web3 concepts:

* Mass is money: Unlike Ogar3's score system, your mass in Togar3 represents real tokens with monetary value.
* Solo play: While teaming isn't prevented, Togar3 focuses on individual competition.
* Dynamic mass balance: Larger cells move faster but consume more food, losing the excess to the Food Bank. This bank generates new food when supplies dwindle.
* Balanced entry fee: Players contribute 300 food (10 mass + 290 to the Food Bank) upon joining. Earning 290 mass breaks even, and the TeaFluencer airdrop covers this fee.
* Z-transfer for safety: Press Z (or use the mobile transfer button) to save your mass to your bank account, protecting it even if you're eliminated.
* Timed rounds and fresh starts: Each game session lasts 30 minutes per player, with a total round duration of 1 hour (subject to change). At the end, everyone keeps their earned tokens and a new round begins.
