# Hosting Profitability

Miners deploy their mining machines on the TEA network to earn profit. To start earning on the network, miners will need the following:

* A AWS Nitro machine. The TEA Project runs on AWS Nitro at the time of mainnet launch
* A CML NFT. Camellia (CML) NFTs are needed as a mining license to activate mining nodes. Miners interested in hosting TApps will purchase a B CML. These are purchased through CML auctions, an open process where winning bids are taken in TEA (which is burned) in exchange for CML.

## How miners determine the potential revenue?

In the TEA Project, we use the terms "mining" and "running a node" interchangeably. There are three types of mining available:

* State machine maintainer mining. Running a state maintainer node helps maintain the TEA Project's state machine. These miners pay a Harberger Tax for the privilege of running a state maintainer node and earns revenue from the memory tax paid by TApps. For more detail please go to [ Harberger Auction TApp](../_2_user_manual/_2_Harberger%20Auction.md)
* CML TApp hosting mining. When a user says they want to mine on the TEA Project, they will probably be running a hosting node.
