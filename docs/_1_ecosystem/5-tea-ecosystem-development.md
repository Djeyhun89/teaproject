# TEA Ecosystem Development

* Miners: They own hardware mining machines, purchase CML (NFT, it's like software license), provide computing services and get rewarded with TEA. Read more in [basic concepts for miners](../_mining/README.md).
* Developers: They use the TEA framework to develop TApps which run on mining machines and provide services to earn revenue which would be distributed to investors and miners according to smart contracts on a bonding curve. You can read more about [basic concepts for developers](../_tapps/Developers.md).
* Investors: Users with TEA funds can invest in mining machines, TApps or even CML and TEA in order to get ROI. Investors can learn more about investing in [entity tokens](../_token/bonding-curve-tokens/TApp-Token-Supply-and-Demand.md).
