# TEA Project Intro

TEA Project is a decentralized cloud computing platform that hosts rich, decentralized applications known as TApps. These are completely serverless and run purely in miners' nodes. By offering highly-scalable and decentralized apps, TEA Project combines the best of both blockchain and cloud computing. 

* The decentralized computing problem that the TEA Project is trying to solve.
* TEA Project's three roots of trust
* How TEA's roots of trust combine together to form TEA's decentralized compute platform. (include link to end of litepaper section for more detail).
* TEA ecosystem development.
* An example application that shows how TEA ecosystem participants interact with each other and the underlying architecture including token incentives. (link to profitability).
* The TEA Project has two tokens: TEA, a utility token used for gas on the network, and CML, and NFT that functions as a mining license. More info is available in our [tokens section](../_token/README.md).

In the TEA project, dApps code runs on a layer-2 WebAssembly runtime inside the hardware protected (TPM) enclaves. These enclaves generate Proof of Trust data handled by blockchain consensus on layer-1. In TEA, blockchain doesn't use consensus to verify the result of dApps code, but the execution environment where the code runs.
