TEA is the utility token for the TEA Project. TEA is used as gas on the TEA network and is necessary for signing transactions. TEA is also the currency that's exchanged by consumers in order to use TApps.

## How to Obtain TEA Tokens

#### \[Testnet\]

Contestants must first [purchase contest COFFEE](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Mining-Contest:-Competitor-Checklist) and put then exchange them for contest TEA. 

#### \[Mainnet\]

After mainnet has launched, users will need to bridge assets from other chains (e.g. bridge USDT from Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain) into the TEA Project network. Once bridged over, users can exchange these tokens for TEA.

## TEA Faucet

Users can login to the TEA browser wallet and <a href="http://198.199.82.222:2900/#/" target="_blank">use the faucet</a> to get enough TEA for their first transactions. Note that this is just a faucet for minuscule amounts of TEA and isn't a replacement for the above methods of obtaining TEA.
