# TEA Tokens

TEA tokens are the primary utility token for the TEA Project. TEA is used as gas on the TEA network and is necessary for signing transactions. TEA is also the currency that's exchanged by consumers in order to use TApps.

TEA can be purchased on Ethereum's layer-1 and shuttled [between Layer1 & Layer2](_token/Billing-system-between-layer1-layer2.md). The total supply of TEA tokens is 100 million. 

## How to Obtain TEA Tokens

#### Testnet

The TEA Fluencer TApp can be used as a retweet faucet (through Twitter) to secure some testnet TEA to compete in the contest. Testnet TEA can be exchanged for COFFEE which are vouchers for mainnet TEA.

#### Mainnet

After mainnet has launched, users will be able to use decentralized exchanges on Ethereum to purchase TEA tokens. Liquidity on centralized exchanges have not yet been formalized.
