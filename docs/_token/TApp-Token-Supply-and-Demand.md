Besides public service mining and staking (e.g. remote attestation), users can take part in the TApp ecosystem to make TEA income.

1. You can be an investor of a TApp by buying into its bonding curve and investing in the project.
1. You can host a TApp using your mining CML to earn a hosting fee. Just like Amazon charges you a cloud hosting fee, you're paid this fee when your machine works as a miner to provide the cloud infrastructure.

During the mining contest, some TApps will represent a particular YouTube video. A non-playing character (NPC) account will check the YouTube videos' increase in views for every 1000 blocks and execute a consume action to benefit these videos' bonding curves commensurate with their increase in views. These regular tipping rounds increase the price as well as the supply of the token. In other words, the tokens you buy for any particular YouTube video's TApp will likely increase the more popular the video becomes. 

These tipping round "consume actions" are meant to mimic how a consumer would pay TEA to use this YouTube TApp: the consumer pays with TEA and these funds are distributed based on the bonding curve's predefined logic. This also holds true for the expenses, such as paying for hosting fees.

The bonding curve is constantly changing. Every consumption and expense event will make the price (and supply) change a bit.

# TApp Token Strategy

Using your TEA to invest in the bonding curve of TApps is generally a smart investment. If you invest in the correct TApp, it makes much more than just holding onto the TEA. Of course, if you don’t choose wisely, that will affect your standing on the leader board. That's because your total asset value is calculated based on how many TApp tokens you own multiplied by the current token sell price. Because the market cap of your bonding curve tokens is part of how your assets are evaluated on the leader board, it’s very important to choose your TApps wisely.

Contestants can choose to invest in a YouTube video's TApp token and use their social influence to increase the value of their YouTube TApp investment. They can use curation marketing and their social media influence to pump up the views by sharing the YouTube link and spreading its popularity on social media. Each day the YouTube video with the highest increase in views will have TEA funds sent to it as a consume action.

This is the magic of the bonding curve. The TEA project uses what's called an augmented bonding curve. It supports both "consume" and "expense" actions. Your token supply will increase when there are consume actions for the TApp and decrease when there are expense actions coming from the TApp.

#### Consume Action

When a consumer spends (pays for usage) of a TApp, the TEA they spend is paid into this TApp's operational account. Since the consumer has used the service in exchange for TEA, their transaction is completed. 

The TEA they spend on the TApp is used to buy its TApp token. These newly minted tokens will then be distributed to all token holders, and that is how your token balance increases. Because the person who paid to use the TApp has already received the service already, they won't receive any newly minted tokens for their transaction. 

Investors who own a TApp's token are stakeholders in that app. They're like stock holders own some percentage of the project and receive a dividend every time the TApp is used.

#### Expense Action (Only Relevant for Fixed Hosting Cost TApps)

TApp creators can choose to use a fixed hosting fee model where the hosting costs to miners is met by selling the TApp's tokens for TEA tokens. When the TApp pays the hosting fee to miners, this is called an "expense". This is the opposite operation of "consume": the TApp will sell the TApp token for TEA to pay for hosting services. The token comes from all TApp token holders, which will cause their token balance to decrease.

There is a chance that a TApp is not popular and cannot earn enough money from consumers to support its payment to miners. In this case, the TApp's token price and total supply will drop to zero. This would be the death of the TApp. Of course, investors lose all of their investment in this scenario so choose your TApp tokens wisely.

There's also an option for TApp creators where hosts share TApp token revenue when the TApp does well but doesn't receive anything otherwise. This payout model has no expenses and potentially unlimited upside for miners. The only drawback is that there's no guaranteed regular payouts for miners using the TApp token revenue model for hosts.
