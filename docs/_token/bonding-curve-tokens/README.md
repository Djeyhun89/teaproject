# Bonding Curve Tokens

A bonding curve is a mathematical concept used to describe the relationship between price and the supply of an asset. As supply in the bonding curve increases, the price also has a commensurate increase.

The TEA Project features two types of investment tokens issued on bonding curves:

* A TApp uses bonding curves to issue their [TApp tokens](tapp-tokens.md). 
* A CML node will also issue separate [CML bonding curve tokens](CML-mining-tokens.md).

These are investable tokens that may be purchased from the **Investments** tab in the TEA browser wallet as explained further [here](TApps-Tokens-List.md).

The bonding curve tokens have a [theta %](Bonding-Curve-Theta.md) associated with them as well as [supply & demand values](TApp-Token-Supply-and-Demand.md) that are determined by a curve.
