# TEA Tokens

TEA is the utility token for the TEA Project. TEA is used as gas on the TEA network and is necessary for signing transactions. TEA is also the currency that's exchanged by consumers in order to use TApps.

The total supply of TEA tokens is 100 million. TEA tokens will be pre-allocated to investors, community members, the team, as well as being earmarked for other functions (liquidity pool / marketing). There will be 100 million TEA tokens pre-allocated in the genesis block, but most of that will be doled out according to a 1-2 year vesting schedule. When the TEA project mainnet goes live, miners will start to get TEA rewards through TEA mining (e.g. public services). 

## How to Obtain TEA Tokens

#### Testnet

The TEA Fluencer TApp can be used as a retweet faucet (through Twitter) to secure some testnet TEA to compete in the contest. Testnet TEA can be exchanged for COFFEE which are vouchers for mainnet TEA.

#### Mainnet

After mainnet has launched, users will need to bridge assets from other chains (e.g. bridge USDT from Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain) into the TEA Project network. Once bridged over, users can exchange these tokens for TEA.
