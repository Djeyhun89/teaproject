# CML Tokens

Unlike TEA tokens, CML (Camellia) is an NFT (non-fungible token) and also functions as a special software license. Each CML has a different lifecycle just as each tree is different in nature. After a miner purchases frozen CML, they must wait for it to defrost to mine with it. Once their CML is defrosted, the miner can plant the CML into a mining machine to start mining to harvest TEA tokens. 

## Mechanics of utilizing CML tokens

The primary use case for CML is to run a hosting node on the TEA network. Prospective miners should keep in mind the following aspects of CML tokens.

* CML are purchased at auction using the [Seed Auction TApp](Marketplace-Auctions.md). The total available supply of CML up for auction is dependent on demand for computing resources in the TEA network since CML hosting nodes provide TEA's compute infrastructure. As consumer demand for infrastructure exceeds supply, then more CML seeds will be made available for auction algorithmically by the TEA DAO.
* CML is planted into machines to activate them as hosting nodes for the TEA Project. The process of getting a hosting node online is covered in our [mining section](../_mining/README.md).
* CML has a lifespan of approximately 2 years after which it dies. If a miner still wishes to host a node after their planted CML dies then they'll need to purchase a new CML seed.
* If a miner wants to move their CML to a new machine, then they can follow the [CML migration guide](CML-Migration-Transfer.md)
