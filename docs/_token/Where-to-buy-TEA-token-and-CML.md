# TEA & CML - Where to Buy

## TEA Token

TEA tokens will be pre-allocated to investors, community members, the team, as well as being earmarked for other functions (liquidity pool / marketing). There will be 100 million TEA tokens pre-allocated in the genesis block, but most of that will be distributed according to a 1-2 year vesting schedule. When the TEA project mainnet goes live, miners will start to get TEA rewards through TEA mining (e.g. public services). 

## Camellia (CML)

Unlike TEA tokens, CML is an NFT (non-fungible token) and also functions as a special software license. Each CML has a different lifecycle just as each tree is different in nature. After a miner purchases frozen CML, they must wait for it to defrost to mine with it. Once their CML is defrosted, the miner can plant this CML into a mining machine to start mining to harvest TEA tokens.

The total supply of CML is determined by demand for computing resources on the network which takes into consideration replacement of CML that have died off. All CML are developed by ELK Insight LLC (US) and authorizes them to TEA Project Inc (Singapore). 

CML seeds are available to purchase through the Seed Auction available in the TApp Store.
