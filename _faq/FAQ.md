# TEA Project Epochs
The TEA Project will be running on testnets through Epoch 13. The different testing phases are broken up into **epochs** with Epoch 11 marking our transition to Ethereum's Goerli testnet. Each epoch has its own contest associated with it where end-users compete to gain testnet TEA tokens which can be redeemed for mainnet TEA vouchers (COFFEE).

## How to Participate in an Epoch

To participate in a testnet epoch to earn COFFEE tokens redeemable for mainnet TEA:

1. Set up an Ethereum address using the MetaMask wallet.
2. Use the **TEA Fluencer** TApp to quote retweet the listed tweet and activate the testnet TEA faucet.
3. Use the **Leader Board** TApp to register for the current epoch competition. Registering on the Leader Board will ensure that your testnet TEA tokens are counted for distribution of COFFEE rewards and for rollover into the next epoch.

## I've purchased a CML - What can I do with it?

CML is an NFT of the TEA Project that serves as a mining license. When users choose your CML node to host a TApp they want to use, you'll earn revenue in the form of the gas fee the end-user pays to run the TApp on your node.

Note that after planting into a mining machine, each CML will have a life span of approximately 2 weeks during the testnet epochs. This is an accelerated schedule specifically for the testnet as mainnet CML will have a lifespan of approximately 2 years.

## How to get started as a miner?

You will need to setup mining machine then, follow the steps in the [mining guide for the current epoch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOhw_qkI0ILWh5HDI8ZiFARjfkfvNPqev).

## What are TApps?
Decentralized apps (dApps) are known as TApps in the TEA ecosystem. Each TApp has a token associated with it that's issued on a bonding curve, which means early buyers reap more rewards as the supply of the TApp Token increases. 

Miners are also paid out in TApp tokens when they host TApps who've elected to payout in their own tokens. For more information about TApps, visit this [collection of links explaining TApps](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/TApps).

## Are the TEA and CML in the contest real tokens?

No, they're part of the simulation. CML and TEA during the competition should be thought of as "testnet CML" and "testnet TEA" which have no relation to mainnet CML or TEA. Even though these two coins are fictitious for the purposes of our mining contest, the testnet TEA that contestants earn during the contest will be exchanged for COFFEE during the epochs. The COFFEE can be exchanged for real TEA after the mainnet launches.


## Is it possible to be a TEA miner by using a Raspberry Pi?
Currently, all mining is simulated as we’re on testnet. When mainnet launches, the TEA Project will require mining machines that have TPM chips on-board and run a specially designed NixOS. At this early stage, you cannot use your existing PC for mining even though your PC already has a TPM chip on the motherboard. Initially, AWS Nitro will be the first approved mining machine. The next available will be IoT mining machines such as a customized Raspberry Pi.

When mainnet starts, only AWS Nitro will be used. Mining with an RPi is on our roadmap for after mainnet launches, but there's no ETA on when that will be.

## On which network is the TEA token on?

The TEA token is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network. The mainnet target launch date is early 2023, and more information is available in the [when will the mainnet be live?](When-will-the-mainnet-be-live.md) document.

TEA project is a layer2 solution that will run above multiple blockchains (layer1) in the future though Ethereum will remain our primary layer1 .

## Can I get more than 1 CML with one TEA Project account? 
Yes, you can purchase an unlimited number of CML with one account.

## How many CML will be launched on the mainnet?
Initial limit of 10k, then controlled algorithmically by the DAO according to supply and demand after year 2. After the mainnet starts, the DAO will start to generate CML seeds and put them into the marketplace for auction.

## How long is each testnet epoch, and how does it compare to mainnet?

The testnet epochs are on an accelerated schedule during contests with 10 blocks per minute.

We originally compressed 2 years time into 14 days, using the accelerated shedule of 14 (days) * 24 (hours) * 60 (minutes) * 10 (blocks per minute) during the testnet. But the epochs have evolved to last varying lengths of time as the team will move to a new epoch only once they feel enough progress has been made.

## What is the leaderboard?
The Leaderboard is a TApp that shows an updated list of how well contestants are doing based on their net asset value. Note that the leaderboard calculation doesn't take into consideration the value of your COFFEE vouchers (i.e. when you exchange some of your testnet TEA for COFFEE vouchers, you're asset value will go down).

## How to invest in TEA Project?
If you are an accredited investor (e.g. a VC), please contact us at  info@teaproject.org to join our private sale.
 
If you’re an individual, so far the best way is to join the various epoch competitions. Your earned testnet TEA tokens can be converted into COFFEE which can be converted into mainnet TEA.

More information on our mainnet CML and TEA as well as how to invest is available [in our wiki](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Where-to-buy-TEA-token-and-CML%3F).


## A page I had bookmarked is now missing?
Because epochs change, some information in the wiki is no longer relevant and becomes outdated. In an effort to keep the wiki useful, we will delete these pages from the wiki though you may find some of them still in [our archive](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/issues/106).
