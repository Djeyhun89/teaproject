- [Bonding Curve Theta](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Bonding-Curve-Theta) is the percentage of every consume action (i.e. usage of the TApp) that goes directly to the developer / TApp creator. The rest is distributed as dividends to token holders which includes miners and investors.
- [TApp Token Supply and Demand](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/TApp-Token-Supply-and-Demand) explains how TApp token supply is related to price.
- Miners receive [Staked TApp Tokens](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Mining:-Staked-TApp-Tokens) for TApps that choose this revenue payout model. This is a method for TEA Project miners to become investors.
