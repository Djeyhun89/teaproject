# TEA Tokens
TEA is the utility token for the TEA Project. TEA is used as gas on the TEA network and is necessary for signing transactions. TEA is also the currency that's exchanged by consumers in order to use TApps.

The total supply of TEA tokens is 100 million.

## How to Obtain Initial TEA Tokens

#### Testnet
Users can login to the TEA browser wallet and select the TEA Fluencer TApp to use as a retweet faucet (through Twitter) to secure some testnet TEA to compete in the contest.

#### Mainnet
After mainnet has launched, users will need to bridge assets from other chains (e.g. bridge USDT from Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain) into the TEA Project network. Once bridged over, users can exchange these tokens for TEA.
